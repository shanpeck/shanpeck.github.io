                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Shan Peck and I'm from the Boise, Idaho area. I went to St. Joseph's Catholic School for 1st through 8th grade. Then I went to Bishop Kelly High School, 
                    which was where most of the people from the Catholic K-8s went. My mom and I haved moved around Boise a lot but in theory, we have now settled in a house in Garden City.
                    We have had multiple dogs throughout my life. My mom is definitely a dog person and she even used to show dogs. The first dogs I remember having were a pair of Maltese;
                    a female named Sky and a male I named Tiger. They've both been gone for years now. We now have two other Maltese named Tommy and Dee Dee, as well as a German Shepherd we named 
                    Mystery. Mystery is quite a bit bigger than Tommy and Dee Dee so has some trouble playing with them, so we separate them sometimes. My mom has talked about wanting to get another
                    German Shepherd to keep Mystery company but I've told her that that would be too many dogs! As much as I love dogs, 4 dogs would be a lot to take care of, especially since I'm at
                    college most of the year.</p> <br>
                    <p>At Bishop Kelly, I was a member of multiple clubs: French Club, Dead Economists Society, and Human Rights Club. I took French instead of Spanish in high school because I had
                    always wanted to go to Paris. I did end up getting to go my senior year with my class. I was supposed to go junior year but COVID made us postpone it. Also in my senior year,
                    I became the Vice President of the French Club. I joined the Dead Economists Society because I took Macroeconomics and Microeconomics my senior year. The teacher for both of
                    those classes also ran the club. I was Co-Secretary. One thing I really enjoyed doing in the club was using a website called Kiva where we could give microloans to aspiring
                    small business owners who would then (hopefully) pay us back. It was cool to see all the people out there from different countries looking to start businesses. We tended to
                    stick to loaning to individual women whose goals we wanted to see come to fruition. I was not as involved in the Human Rights Club as I wanted to be but from the few meetings
                    I attended, I felt like it was a great environment to learn more about different cultures.</p> <br>
                    <p>The part of high school that impacted me the most was running cross country. I ran cross country and track for all four years, but cross country was the sport that really
                    changed my life. I had never been great at putting myself out there or being the person that makes a lot of friends easily; I had had the same friends for most of my life since
                    I went to a K-8. Cross country forced me out of my comfort zone and it was really tough at first. Distance running is so much more difficult than people make it out to be and
                    I had no friends going in. One of my friends did end up sometimes coming to practices freshman year, but she didn't keep doing it after that. I remember I had skipped the first
                    ever meet I was supposed to run at because I didn't feel ready at all. Before the second one, I told my mom that I wanted to quit. She told me that we'd talk to Coach about it
                    together at the second meet. Well, that day came and she was nowhere in sight at the beginning. So, I ran the meet... and then I kept doing it for the rest of high school. There
                    were a lot of times when it sucked, but I made so many friends and genuinely felt good about myself because I joined the cross country team. If there's one thing I miss about high
                    school, this is it.</p> <br>
